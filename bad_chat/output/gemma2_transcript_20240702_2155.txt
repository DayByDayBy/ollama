User: Error during generation: model 'gemma2' not found, try pulling it first
Model: A common error in the Hugging Face transformers library!

The error message "model 'gemma2' not found" indicates that the `transformers` library is unable to find a pre-trained language model with the name `'gemma2'`.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Check if you have installed the correct package**: Make sure you have installed the `transformers` library and the specific model you're trying to use (in this case, `gemma2`). You can install it using pip: `pip install transformers`.
2. **Verify that the model exists**: Check if a pre-trained language model named `'gemma2'` actually exists in the Hugging Face Model Hub. You can do this by searching for the model name on the [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). If it doesn't exist, you might need to train your own model or use a different one.
3. **Try pulling the model**: The error message suggests that you try pulling the model using `transformers`. You can do this by running:
```python
import transformers

transformers.pull('gemma2')
```
This command will attempt to download and cache the pre-trained language model.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more context or details about your code and the error message you're seeing. I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot!
